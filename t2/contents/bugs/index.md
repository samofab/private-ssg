## How to report a website bug - concise version
0. Indicate clearly to which *project* the bug belongs
1. If you have multiple issues, please file separate bug reports
2. Make sure that you're watching the latest version of website/product. Try "Ctrl+F5"
3. Include uncropped screenshot, which includes a clearly readable **full url**, *date and time*, *browser and version*.
4. Provide precise steps to *reproduce* the bug, *expected* results and *actual* results 
5. Enter a *clear unique* title; check if the bug has already been reported
## The long version
### Why good bug report
If your bug report is effective, chances are higher that it will get fixed. So fixing a bug depends on how effectively you report it. A bug report should contain a lot of information, the more you supply, the better.
### When to send a bug report
Short answer, *always*. Longer answer, when:
- You see an error message, send a bug report
- The screen is blank or data is missing, send a bug report
- When the program does not behave as expected, send a bug report
- When the program crashes, freezes, becomes non-responsive or is slow, send a bug report
- When you don’t get what you need from the software, send a bug report
- If you cannot figure out how to do something, send a bug report
- If you don’t like the way it does things, or the software annoys you, send a bug report
### What should a bug include
0. *Uncropped* screenshot.
1. *Title*: Create a short title for the report, and please be clear what the issue is.
2. *Product/Website*:  Identify the product, by name and *full URL*.
3. *Platform*: operating system name and version and web browser name and version
4. *Date and time* of the occurance
5. *How to reproduce* (if not as trivial as clicking on the provided link)
6. *expected* results 
7. *actual* results 
### Writing a clear bug title
A good title should quickly and uniquely identify a bug report. It should explain the problem, not your suggested solution.
- Good: "Submiting a Package Inqury Form, the email subject doesn't include Package name"
- Bad: "Website doesn't work"

- Good: "Error 402: Access denied when clicking ‘Send Email’"

- Instead of: Sorting is not working properly.
- Try: Sorting is happening in reverse order.

- Instead of: Issues with GUI on navigation bar.
- Try: Navigation bar is wrapping to a second line.
### Hints and tips
- *Be specific*: Use the exact same words as the application. If you see something, write it as is. If you click something, write it’s exact name.
- *Don’t get personal*: You are reporting a bug, not discussing the developer’s nature or the quality of the software. Bug reports that contain offensive or emotional language will be ignored. 
- *It’s not you*: You did not create the bug. You did not break the system. It’s not your fault. You are not stupid. There exists a bug, the system broke, now lets find it and fix it.
- *Report the first error you see*: Oftentimes, people get so used to an error that they become tuned to ignoring it. So when a new error occurs, they report that as the “first” error they saw. Not true. If a part of a system has failed, the next error may be a result of the first failure and not a real error in itself. We need to know if you ignored a crash before you got this error.
