## How to report a bug - concise version
0. Indicate clearly to which *project* the bug belongs
1. If you have multiple issues, please file separate bug reports
2. Make sure that you're watching the latest version of website/product. Try "Ctrl+F5"
3. Include uncropped screenshot, which includes a clearly readable **full url**, *date and time*, *browser and version*.
4. Provide precise steps to *reproduce* the bug, *expected* results and *actual* results 
5. Enter a *clear unique* title; check if the bug has already been reported
## The long version
### Why good Bug report
If your bug report is effective, chances are higher that it will get fixed. So fixing a bug depends on how effectively you report it. A bug report should contain a lot of information, the more you supply, the better.
### When to send a bug report
Short answer, *always*. Longer answer, when:
- You see an error message, send a bug report
- The screen is blank or data is missing, send a bug report
- When the program does not behave as expected, send a bug report
- When the program crashes, freezes, becomes non-responsive or is slow, send a bug report
- When you don’t get what you need from the software, send a bug report
- If you cannot figure out how to do something, send a bug report
- If you don’t like the way it does things, or the software annoys you, send a bug report

### Writing a clear bug title
A good title should quickly and uniquely identify a bug report. It should explain the problem, not your suggested solution.
- Good: "Submiting a Package Inqury Form, the email subject doesn't include Package name"
- Bad: "Website doesn't work"

- Good: "Error 402: Access denied when clicking ‘Send Email’"
